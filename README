# dotfiles-2

New repo to create new standardized development, based around modernized tooling and AI development.

- native TS note CLI setup and installer scripts
- helix instead of neovim
- simplified and new theme of tmux
- zoxide alias support
- fzf alias support

Targeting shells:
- zshrc
- bashrc

## Main goals

This purpose of this "new" version is mainly to simplify and improve my terminal workflow around some more modern tooling, specifically helix, which I've found to be **vastly** more user friendly and just as capable as neovim
