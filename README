# dotfiles-2

New repo to create new standardized development, based around modernized tooling and AI development.

- native TS note CLI setup and installer scripts
- helix instead of neovim
- simplified and new theme of tmux
- zoxide alias support
- fzf alias support

Targets exclusively bash for simplicity

## Main goals

This purpose of this "new" version is mainly to simplify and improve my terminal workflow around some more modern tooling, specifically helix, which I've found to be **vastly** more user friendly and just as capable as neovim

## Environment pre-reqs

Use the following to verify the environment
```bash
dotfiles verify
```

The verify command checks for the following:

- **Helix IDE (hx)** - Modern terminal-based text editor
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer
- **nvm** - Node Version Manager (checks for ~/.nvm directory)
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder for command-line
- **zoxide** - Smarter cd command (checks for ~/.local/bin/zoxide)
- **starship** - Cross-shell prompt

## Backing up

```bash
dotfiles backup
```

## Installing

```bash
dotfiles install
```
