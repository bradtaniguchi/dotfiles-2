# dotfiles-2

New repo to create new standardized development, based around modernized tooling and AI development.

- native TS note CLI setup and installer scripts
- helix instead of neovim
- simplified and new theme of tmux
- zoxide alias support
- fzf alias support

Targets exclusively bash for simplicity

## Main goals

This purpose of this "new" version is mainly to simplify and improve my terminal workflow around some more modern tooling, specifically helix, which I've found to be **vastly** more user friendly and just as capable as neovim

## Environment pre-reqs

Use the following to verify the environment:
```bash
dotfiles verify        # Verify all tools
dotfiles verify all    # Verify all tools (explicit)
dotfiles verify helix  # Verify only Helix IDE (alias: hx)
dotfiles verify tmux   # Verify only tmux
dotfiles verify nvm    # Verify only nvm
dotfiles verify fzf    # Verify only fzf
dotfiles verify zoxide # Verify only zoxide
dotfiles verify starship # Verify only starship
dotfiles verify bashrc # Verify bashrc exists and matches configs/bashrc
dotfiles verify gh     # Verify GitHub CLI (optional)
dotfiles verify copilot # Verify GitHub Copilot CLI (optional)
dotfiles verify htop   # Verify htop (optional)
```

The verify command checks for the following:

**Required Tools:**
- **Helix IDE (hx)** - Modern terminal-based text editor
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer
- **nvm** - Node Version Manager (checks for ~/.nvm directory)
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder for command-line
- **zoxide** - Smarter cd command (checks for ~/.local/bin/zoxide)
- **starship** - Cross-shell prompt
- **bashrc** - Bash configuration file (verifies existence and content match with configs/bashrc)

**Optional/Recommended Tools:**
- **gh** - GitHub CLI (recommended for GitHub Copilot integration)
- **copilot** - GitHub Copilot CLI (AI-powered CLI assistance)
- **htop** - Enhanced system monitoring tool

## Backing up

```bash
dotfiles backup
```

## Installing
