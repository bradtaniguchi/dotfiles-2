# dotfiles-2

New repo to create new standardized development, based around modernized tooling and AI development.

- native TS note CLI setup and installer scripts
- helix instead of neovim
- simplified and new theme of tmux
- zoxide alias support
- fzf alias support

Targeting shells:
- zshrc
- bashrc

## Main goals

This purpose of this "new" version is mainly to simplify and improve my terminal workflow around some more modern tooling, specifically helix, which I've found to be **vastly** more user friendly and just as capable as neovim

## Local Development

To use the CLI locally during development:

```bash
# Link the CLI globally (one-time setup)
npm link

# Now you can use the dotfiles command directly
dotfiles <command> [options]
dotfiles install --force
dotfiles sync

```

### Check types without running
npm run check-types

### Lint and format code
npm run lint
npm run format

### Unlink when done (optional)
npm unlink -g dotfiles
```
