# dotfiles-2

New repo to create new standardized development, based around modernized tooling and AI development.

- native TS note CLI setup and installer scripts
- helix instead of neovim
- simplified and new theme of tmux
- zoxide alias support
- fzf alias support

Targets exclusively bash for simplicity

## Main goals

This purpose of this "new" version is mainly to simplify and improve my terminal workflow around some more modern tooling, specifically helix, which I've found to be **vastly** more user friendly and just as capable as neovim

## Usage

This repo comes with a TS native node@24+ CLI that can be setup with
```bash
npm link
```

use `npm unlink -g dotfiles` to deactivate this.

use `dotfiles --help` to get help

## Environment pre-reqs

Use the following to verify the environment
```bash
dotfiles verify
```

To verify the current environment of all the neccessary installed tooling
